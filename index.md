## 🔧 Professional Positioning

**AI & IoT Systems Integrator for Complex Environments**

I design and deploy full-stack AI and IoT systems — from edge telemetry and embedded analytics to secure, audit-ready pipelines — across pharma, energy, and public infrastructure.

As a hands-on consultant and long-term system owner, I take on missions that demand autonomy, resilience, and high-impact delivery. Security, compliance, and traceability are built-in by design, not added later.

I don’t seek roles — I deliver infrastructure that lasts and aligns with business-critical goals.

## 🧭 How I Work – Technical Engagement Framework

- 🔁 I take on one mission at a time, under clear contractual scope and delivery targets.
- 🛡️ Every system includes versioned models, traceable pipelines, rollback capabilities, and secure deployment policies.
- 📊 I work within SLAs or milestone-based scopes, ensuring technical accountability and auditability.
- ⚙️ I respect legacy systems, but I redesign when scale or survival demand it.
